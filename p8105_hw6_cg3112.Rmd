# Problem 1

```{r}
births <- read_csv("./birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(
   babysex = as.factor(babysex),
   frace = as.factor(frace),
   malform = as.factor(malform),
   mrace = as.factor(mrace)
  )

```

Checking for missing data:
```{r}
skimr::skim(births)
```
There does not appear to be any missing values.

Lets propose a model based on scientific knowledge of predictors of birth weight:

```{r}
weight <-
  lm(bwt ~ momage + delwt + smoken + wtgain, data = births) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>%
   knitr::kable(digits = 3)

weight
```

We'll next add the residuals and predictions: 
```{r}
res_pred <- weight %>%
   modelr::add_residuals(fit) %>%
   modelr::add_predictions(fit)
```
